# Golf Fantasy Backend

Backend API for Golf Fantasy, built with Flask.

## Setup
1. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create `.env` file with required environment variables
5. Run development server: `gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py "run:app"`

## Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication is used for user authentication in the Golf Fantasy website. It provides a secure and easy-to-use authentication system, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and manage their account credentials.

## Database: MySQL

The Golf Fantasy website utilizes a MySQL database for storing and managing data. Here is a placeholder description of the DB structure:

- `golfer` : Stores information about golf players, including their name, nationality, and ranking.
- `league` : Represents the fantasy leagues created by users, containing details like league name, member, commisioner, and owner.
- `user` : Contains information about registered users, such as their username, email, link to their avatar photo, etc.
- `roles` : list of roles, permissions associated with those roles


## Docker Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- `.env` file with required environment variables
- Google Cloud service account key (`google-cloud-key.json`)

### Environment Setup
Required files in project root:
- Dockerfile
- .env
- google-cloud-key.json (service account credentials)

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t fantasy-golf .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5001:5001 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/google-cloud-key.json:/app/google-cloud-key.json" \
  fantasy-golf
```

### Key Configuration
The Dockerfile sets up a Python environment with the following configuration:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.13-slim
WORKDIR /app
ENV PORT=5001
ENV FLASK_APP=run.py
ENV FLASK_ENV=production
ENV GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/google-cloud-key.json
```

### Health Checks
Verify the application is running correctly:
- API Health: `GET http://localhost:5001/health`
- Database Health: `GET http://localhost:5001/db-health`

### Important Notes
- Uses App Engine default service account for Cloud SQL access
- Port 5001 is used instead of 5000 to avoid conflicts with macOS services
- Gunicorn is used as the production server
- Environment variables are loaded from .env file


## More Info

For more information on Next.js, Flask, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Storage, refer to the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Firebase Authentication Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
<!-- - [Firebase Storage Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Run the API

To run the Flask API in development mode:
1. From the root directory, run `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Navigate to the `src/api` directory:
3. Run `flask run dev`
4. Hopefully it works


### Run the frontend

To run the frontend in development mode:

1. Navigate to the root directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`


## TODO List

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Optimize golfer photo loading in dropdown
  - [ ] Implement client-side caching for Firebase Storage URLs
  - [ ] Preload images for frequently accessed golfers
  - [ ] Configure Firebase Storage CDN settings

### Security Improvements

#### Firebase Storage Rules
Current rules allow public read access to all profile images. Need to implement more granular access:
- Restrict profile image access to:
  - The image owner
  - Members of the same league
  - League commissioners
- Current temporary rules:

### Technical Debt & Improvements
